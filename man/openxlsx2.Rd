\description{
This R package is a modern reinterpretation of the widely used popular
\code{openxlsx} package. Similar to its predecessor, it simplifies the creation of xlsx
files by providing a clean interface for writing, designing and editing worksheets.
Based on a powerful XML library and focusing on modern programming flows in pipes
or chains, \code{openxlsx2} allows to break many new ground.

\details{
The openxlsx package uses global options to simplify formatting:

\itemize{
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.borderColor" = "black")}}
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.borderStyle" = "thin")}}
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.dateFormat" = "mm/dd/yyyy")}}
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.datetimeFormat" = "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss")}}
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.numFmt" = NULL)}}
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.paperSize" = 9)}} ## A4
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.orientation" = "portrait")}} ## page orientation
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.sheet.default_name" = "Sheet")}}
\item{\code{options("openxlsx2.rightToLeft" = NULL)}}
}
By default, openxlsx2 uses the American English word for color (written with 'o' instead of the British English 'ou'). However, both spellings are supported. So where the documentation uses a 'color', the function should also accept a 'color'. However, this is not indicated by the autocompletion.
