Description: Simplifies the creation of Excel .xlsx files by
    providing a high level interface to writing, styling and editing
    worksheets. Through the use of 'Rcpp', read/write times are comparable
    to the 'xlsx' and 'XLConnect' packages with the added benefit of
    removing the dependency on Java.
