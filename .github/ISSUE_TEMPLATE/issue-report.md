For best results from devs, please follow this guidance:

1. Run your examples with the latest version (`remotes::install_github("JanMarvin/openxlsx2"`)
1. Utilize the [`reprex` package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) and create a **minimal** reproducible example
1. Utilize [`dput()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/dput.html) for data 
1. Provide version with `packageVersion("openxlsx2")` (if you didn't follow the step above, this will be a problem)
1. Utilize `openxlsx2::temp_xlsx()` for file saving
1. If needed, take a screen shot of your Excel workbook :camera:
1. Be friendly :smile:
