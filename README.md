<!-- badges: end -->

This R package is a modern reinterpretation of the widely used popular
`openxlsx` package. Similar to its predecessor, it simplifies the
creation of xlsx files by providing a clean interface for writing,
designing and editing worksheets. Based on a powerful XML library and
focusing on modern programming flows in pipes or chains, `openxlsx2`
allows to break many new ground.

Even though the project is already well progressed and supports most of
the features known and appreciated from the predecessor, there may still
be open gaps in one or the other place. A quick warning: Until the
stable version 1.0 there ~~may~~ will still be some changes to the API.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `openxlsx2` with:

``` r
install.packages('openxlsx2')
```

You can install the development version of `openxlsx2` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JanMarvin/openxlsx2")
```

Or from [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) with:

``` r
# Enable repository from janmarvin
options(repos = c(
  janmarvin = 'https://janmarvin.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install openxlsx2 in R
install.packages('openxlsx2')
```

## Introduction

`openxlsx2` aims to be the swiss knife for working with the openxml
spreadsheet formats xlsx and xlsm (other formats of other spreadsheet
software are not supported). We offer two different variants how to work
with `openxlsx2`.

- The first one is to simply work with R objects. It is possible to read
  ([`read_xlsx()`](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/read_xlsx.html))
  and write
  ([`write_xlsx()`](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/write_xlsx.html))
  data from and to files. We offer a number of options in the commands
  to support various features of the openxml format, including reading
  and writing named ranges and tables. Furthermore, there are several
  ways to read certain information of an openxml spreadsheet without
  having opened it in a spreadsheet software before, e.g.Â to get the
  contained sheet names or tables.
- As a second variant `openxlsx2` offers the work with so called
  [`wbWorkbook`](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/wbWorkbook.html)
  objects. Here an openxml file is read into a corresponding
  `wbWorkbook` object
  ([`wb_load()`](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/wb_load.html))
  or a new one is created
  ([`wb_workbook()`](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/wb_workbook.html)).
  Afterwards the object can be further modified using various functions.
  For example, worksheets can be added or removed, the layout of cells
  or entire worksheets can be changed, and cells can be modified
  (overwritten or rewritten). Afterwards the `wbWorkbook` objects can be
  written as openxml files and processed by suitable spreadsheet
  software.

Many examples how to work with `openxlsx2` are in our [manual
pages](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/index.html) and
in our [vignettes](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/). You
can find them under:

``` r
vignette(package = "openxlsx2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(openxlsx2)
# read xlsx or xlsm files
path <- system.file("extdata/openxlsx2_example.xlsx", package = "openxlsx2")
read_xlsx(path)
