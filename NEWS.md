# development (new)

* Moves `openxlsxFontSizeLookupTable` and `openxlsxFontSizeLookupTableBold` to `data-raw` directory ([#7](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/7))

# development (old)

## Fixes

* `write.xlsx()` now successfully passes `withFilter` ([#151](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/151))

## New features

* `write.xlsx()` can now handle `colWidths` passed as either a single element or a `list()`

# openxlsx 4.2.3.9000

## New Features

* Added ability to change positioning of summary columns and rows.
	* These can be set with the `summaryCol` and `summaryRow` arguments in `pageSetup()`.

# openxlsx 4.2.3
 
## New Features

* Most of functions in openxlsx now support non-ASCII arguments better. More specifically, we can use non-ASCII strings as names or contents for `createNamedRegion()` ([#103](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/103)), `writeComment()`, `writeData()`, `writeDataTable()` and `writeFormula()`. In addition, openxlsx now reads comments and region names that contain non-ASCII strings correctly on Windows. Thanks to @shrektan for the PR [#118](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/pull/118).

* `setColWidths()` now supports zero-length `cols`, which is convinient when `cols` is dynamically provided [#128](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/128). Thanks to @shrektan for the feature request and the PR.
