# openxlsx2 (in development)

* Provide internal helper `xml_rm_child()` to remove children of XML strings. [273](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/273)

* Add new options to data validation. allow type custom, add arguments `errorStyle`, `errorTitle`, `error`, `promptTitle`, `prompt`. [271](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/271)

* Provide `wb_clone_sheet_style()`. This improves upon the now deprecated`cloneSheetStyle()` that existed as an early draft. [233](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/233)

* Various (mostly internal) changes to `conditional_formatting`. Created `style_mgr` integration for `dxf` (cf-styles) and cleaned up internal code. The syntax has changed slightly, see [conditional formatting vignette](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/conditional-formatting.html) for reference. Add `whitespace` argument to `read_xml()`. [268](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/268)

* `wb$add_data()` now checks earlier for missing `x` argument.  [246](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/165)

# openxlsx2 0.2.1

## New features

* Provide optional `na.strings` argument when writing data to sheets. It can be used to add a custom character string when writing numeric data.

* Improve writing `NA`, `NaN`, and `-Inf`/`Inf`. `NA` will be converted to `#N/A`; `NaN` will be converted to `#VALUE!`; `Inf` will be converted to `#NUM!`. The same conversion is not applied when reading from a workbook. [256](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/256)

* Many `wbWorkbook` methods now contain default sheet values of `current_sheet()` or `next_sheet()` (e.g., `$add_worksheet(sheet = next_sheet())`, `$write_data(sheet = curret_sheet()`).  These internal waiver functions allow the `wbWorkbook` object to use default expectations for what sheet to interact with.  This allows the easier workflow of `wb$add_worksheet()$add_data(x = data.frame())` where `$add_worksheet()` knows to add a new worksheet (with a default name), sets that new worksheet to the current worksheet, and then `$add_data()` picks up the new sheet and places the data there. [165](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/165), [179](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/179)

* New functions `wb_add_cell_style()` and `wb$add_cell_style()` to simplify the creation of cell styles for cells on the sheet. This provides a fast way to create cell styles for regions on the worksheet. The cells for which the cell format is to be created must already exist on the worksheet. If the cells already contain a cell format, it will be preserved, except for the updated cell format entries, which will always be created. The function is applied to a continuous cell of the worksheet.
[230](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/230)

* New functions `wb_add_numfmt()` and `wb$add_numfmt()` to simplify the creation of number formats for cells on the sheet. This provides a fast way to create number formats for regions on the worksheet. The cells for which the number format is to be created must already exist on the worksheet. If the cells already contain a cell style, it will be preserved, except for the number format, which will always be created. The function is applied to a continuous cell of the worksheet.
[229](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/229)

* New functions `wb_add_font()` and `wb$add_font()` to simplify the creation of fonts for cells on the sheet. This provides a fast way to create fonts for regions on the worksheet. The cells for which the font is to be created must already exist on the worksheet. If the cells already contain a cell style, it will be preserved, except for the font, which will always be created. The function is applied to a continuous cell of the worksheet.
[228](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/228)

* New functions `wb_add_fill()` and `wb$add_fill()` to simplify the creation of fills for cells on the sheet. This provides a fast way to create color filled regions on the worksheet. The cells for which the fill is to be created must already exist on the worksheet. If the cells already contain a cell style, it will be preserved, except for the filled color, which will always be created. The function is applied to a continuous cell of the worksheet and allows to change the color of every n-th column or row.
[222](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/222)

* New functions `wb_add_border()` and `wb$add_border()` to simplify the creation of borders for cells on the sheet. This is especially useful when creating surrounding borders with different border styles for various cells. The cells for which the border is to be created must already exist on the worksheet. If the cells already contain a cell style, it will be preserved, except for the border, which will always be created. The function is applied to a continuous cell of the worksheet and allows to change the horizontal and vertical internal border grid independently. [220](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/220)

* Enable reading tables with `wb_to_df()`. Tables are handled similar to defined names. [193](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/193)

* Several enhancements have been added for checking and validation worksheet names
[165](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/165)
  * When adding a new worksheet via `wbWorkbook$add_worksheet()` the provided name is checked for illegal characters (see note in **Breaking changes**)
  * `wbWorkbook$get_sheet_names()` (`wb_get_sheet_names()` wrapper) added. These return both the _formatted_ and original sheet names
  * `wbWorkbook$set_sheet_names()` (`wb_set_sheet_names()`) added
    * these make `names.wbWorkbook()` and `names<-.wbWorkbook()` deprecated
    * `wbWorkbook$setSheetName()` deprecated
  * `clean_worksheet_names()` added to support removing characters that are not allowed in worksheet names

## Fixes

* Various fixes to enable handling of non unicode R environments [243](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/243)

* Fix an issue with broken pageSetup reference causing corupt excel files [216](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/216)

* Fix reading and writing comments from workbooks that already provide comments [209](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/209)

* Fix an issue with broken xml in Excels vml files and enable opening xlsm files with `wb$open()` [202](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/202)

* Fix reading and writing on non UTF-8 systems [198](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/198) [199](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/199) [207](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/207)

* Instruct parser to import nodes with whitespaces. This fixes a complaint in spreadsheet software. [189](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/189)

* Fix reading file without row attribute. [187](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/187) [190](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/190)

* Remove reference to `printerSettings.bin` when loading. This binary blob is not included and the reference caused file corruption warnings. [185](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/185)

* Fix loading and writing xlsx files with with `workbook$extLst`. Previously if the loaded sheet contains a slicer, a second `extLst` was added which confused spreadsheet software. Now both are combined into a single node.

* Fix writing xlsx file with multiple entries of conditional formatting type databar on any sheet. [174](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/174)

* Cell fields cm, ph and vm are now implemented for reading and writing. This is the first step to handle functions that use metadata. [173](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/173)

* `wbWorkbook`: `$open()` no longer overwrites the `$path` field to the temporary file [171](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/171)
* `xl_open()` works (better) on Windows [170](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/170)

## Breaking changes

* When writing to existing workbooks, the default value for `removeCellStyle` is now `FALSE`. Therefore if a cell contains a style, it is attempted to replace the value, but not the style of the cell itself.

* `wb_conditional_formatting()` is deprecated in favor of `wb_add_conditional_formatting()` and `wbWorkbook$add_conditional_formatting()`.
  * `type` must now match exactly one of: `"expression"`, `"colorScale"`, `"dataBar"`, `"duplicatedValues"`, `"containsText"`, `"notContainsText"`, `"beginsWith"`, `"endsWith"`, `"between"`, `"topN"`, `"bottomN"`

* Assigning a new worksheet with an illegal character now prompts an error [165](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/165).  See `?clean_worksheet_name` for an easy method of replacing bad characters.

* `openxlsx2Coerce()` (which was called on `x` objects when adding data to a workbook) has been removed.  Users can no longer pass some arbitrary objects and will need to format these objects appropriately or rely on `as.data.frame` methods  [167](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/167)
* `xl_open(file = )` is no longer valid and will throw a warning; first argument has been changes to `x` to highlight that `xl_open()` can be called on a file path or a `wbWorkbook` object [171](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/171)

## Internal changes

* Remove `wb$createFontNode()` which was never used.

* Switch to modern xlsx template, when creating workbooks. Imported workbooks will use the imported template

* Rewrite `wb$tables` to use a data frame approach. This simplifies the code a bit and makes it easier to implement more upcoming changes [191](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/191)

* Update of internal pugixml library

* The two functions `write_data()` and `write_datatable()` now use the same internal function `write_data_table()` to add data to the sheet. This simplifies the code and ensures that both functions are tested. In the same pull request, the documentation has been updated and the `stack=` option, which was not present before, has been removed [175](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/175)

* `wbWorkbook$validate_sheet()` added as an object methods

* private `wbWorkbook` field `original_sheet_names` added to track the original names passed to sheets
* private `$get_sheet()` removed in favor of more explicit
* private `wbWorkbook` methods additions:  
  * `$get_sheet_id_max()`, `$get_sheet_index()` for getting ids
  * `$get_sheet_name()` for getting a sheet name
  * `$set_single_sheet_name()` for setting sheet names
  * `$pappend()` general private appending
  * `$validate_new_sheet()` for checking new sheet names
  * `$append_workbook_field()` for `self$workbook[[field]]`
  * `$append_sheet_rels()` for `self$worksheet_rels[[sheet]]`
  * `$get_worksheet()` to replace `$ws()`
