# openxlsx2 (development version)

## Fixes

* Instruct parser to import nodes with whitespaces. This fixes a complaint in spreadsheet software. [189](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/189)

* Fix reading file without row attribute. [187](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/187) [190](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/190)

* Remove reference to `printerSettings.bin` when loading. This binary blob is not included and the reference caused file corruption warnings. [185](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/185)

* Fix loading and writing xlsx files with with `workbook$extLst`. Previously if the loaded sheet contains a slicer, a second `extLst` was added which confused spreadsheet software. Now both are combined into a single node.

* Fix writing xlsx file with multiple entries of conditional formatting type databar on any sheet. [174](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/174) 

* Cell fields cm, ph and vm are now implemented for reading and writing. This is the first step to handle functions that use metadata. [173](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/173)

* `wbWorkbook`: `$open()` no longer overwrites the `$path` field to the temporary file [171](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/171)
* `xl_open()` works (better) on Windows [170](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/170)

## New features

* Many `wbWorkbook` methods now contain default sheet values of `current_sheet()` or `next_sheet()` (e.g., `$add_worksheet(sheet = next_sheet())`, `$write_data(sheet = curret_sheet()`).  These internal waiver functions allow the `wbWorkbook` object to use default expectations for what sheet to interact with.  This allows the easier workflow of `wb$add_worksheet()$add_data(x = data.frame())` where `$add_worksheet()` knows to add a new worksheet (with a default name), sets that new worksheet to the current worksheet, and then `$add_data()` picks up the new sheet and places the data there. [165](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/165), [179](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/179)

## Breaking changes

* `openxlsx2Coerce()` (which was called on `x` objects when adding data to a workbook) has been removed.  Users can no longer pass some arbitrary objects and will need to format these objects appropriately or rely on `as.data.frame` methods  [167](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/issues/167)
* `xl_open(file = )` is no longer valid and will throw a warning; first argument has been changes to `x` to highlight that `xl_open()` can be called on a file path or a `wbWorkbook` object [171](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/171)

## Internal changes

* Update of internal pugixml library

* The two functions `write_data()` and `write_datatable()` now use the same internal function `write_data_table()` to add data to the sheet. This simplifies the code and ensures that both functions are tested. In the same pull request, the documentation has been updated and the `stack=` option, which was not present before, has been removed [175](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2/pull/175)

# openxlsx2 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* First public release
